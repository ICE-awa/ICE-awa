3.[icezone-smart-card-demo](https://github.com/ICE-awa/icezone-smart-card-demo) An AI flashcard learning platform that uses the SM-2 algorithm for personalized learning. I built it with React, MySQL, and Java Spring Boot, and it's all packed up with Docker. This is just a demo for now, and I'll be refactoring it down the line. Check out the README.md for all the tech specifics! *ï¼ˆCurrently under developing)*
