## Brief Introduction

I'm a undergraduate at South China Normal University(SCNU), contact me via wechat ice_pwp / email HaydenIce@outlook.com /
 
Here's my brief introduction of my repository: (latest updated of the introduction was on 07/01/2025)

1.[ice_algorithm_template](https://github.com/ICE-awa/ice_algorithm_template) This is my algorithm template for ICPC/CCPC, currently in version v1.0.0-alpha.1. Some sections include tutorials while others feature class-based implementations. The content is currently available in Chinese only, and detailed tutorials will be added to all sections in future updates. *(latest updated on 04/08/2025)*

2.[notes](https://github.com/ICE-awa/notes) Using markdown to take notes related to my college courses *(continuous updating)*

3.[icezone-smart-card-demo](https://github.com/ICE-awa/icezone-smart-card-demo) An AI flashcard learning platform that uses the SM-2 algorithm for personalized learning. I built it with React, MySQL, and Java Spring Boot, and it's all packed up with Docker. This is just a demo for now, and I'll be refactoring it down the line. Check out the README.md for all the tech specifics! *ï¼ˆCurrently under developing)*
